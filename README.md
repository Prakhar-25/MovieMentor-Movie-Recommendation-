# Movie-Recommendation-System
This project is a movie recommendation system that employs machine learning techniques, specifically K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm and cosine similarity, to provide personalized movie recommendations to users.

## Overview
The movie recommendation system is built using a dataset of movies and user ratings. It leverages the KNN algorithm to find similar movies based on similarity in ratings and recommends those movies to the user. The similarity between movies is calculated using cosine similarity, a measure of the similarity between two non-zero vectors.
## Technologies Used

- Python: Programming language used for implementing the recommendation system.
- Machine Learning: Utilizes machine learning techniques to generate movie recommendations.
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN): Algorithm used for finding similar movies based on user preferences.
- Cosine Similarity: Measure used for calculating the similarity between movies.
- Flask: Web framework used for building the user interface.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is sourced from https://www.kaggle.com/code/selcukcan/ml-6-4-knn-movie-recommendation-system, and it contains a collection of Movielens 20M movies along with user ratings.
The datasets describe ratings and free-text tagging activities from MovieLens, a movie recommendation service. It contains 20000263 ratings and 465564 tag applications across 27278 movies. These data were created by 138493 users between January 09, 1995 and March 31, 2015. This dataset was generated on October 17, 2016.

Users were selected at random for inclusion. All selected users had rated at least 20 movies.
